# Zoo Management - Java Learning Exercise

This project is a basic Java program that helps users manage a zoo by entering the zoo's name and the number of cages. It is designed as part of an exercise to learn Java programming.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **A text editor or IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChedlyRebai/java-prosits.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd java-prosits
    ```

3. **Compile the Java file**:
    Use the `javac` command to compile the source file.
    ```bash
    javac java-prosits.java
    ```

4. **Run the program**:
    After compiling, run the program with the `java` command:
    ```bash
    java java-prosits
    ```

## How It Works

Once the program starts, it will prompt you to enter:

1. The name of the zoo.
2. The number of cages.

The program will then display a message indicating how many cages the zoo has. If the input for the number of cages is invalid, it will keep asking until a valid number is entered.
